# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection :

This project mainly focuses on Detecting Credit Card frauds using machine learning techniques and Algorithms. More description about building this project is given below :

  * Programming Language used : Python
  
  * TechTools used : 1. Kaggle (for downloading Dataset)
                     2. Jupyter Notebook
                     3. NumPy
                     4. Pandas
                     5. Scikit-Learn
  
  * Machine Learning Model used : LogisticRegression
      -> We choose Logistic Regression model over other classification models such as Random Forest beacuse it does best predictions on the binary datasets.
  
  * Model scores on : 1. Training data : 94.9 %
                      2. Testing data : 92 %
